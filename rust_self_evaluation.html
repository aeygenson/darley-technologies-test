    <h1>Part 1: Self-Evaluation</h1>
    <p>I rate my Rust experience as <strong>6/10</strong>. I started learning Rust about one year ago and used it to build a PnL valuation component for our options portfolio. The component was wrapped in a Python library and showed traders real-time portfolio values based on FX market quotes.</p>

    <p>I always strive to follow best practices in every language I use—including Rust, Python, MATLAB, Scala, and C#. I especially appreciate Rust’s concept of ownership management. Additionally, I regularly apply functional programming concepts like immutability, pattern matching, closures, iterators, and handling errors in a functional way—consistently returning structured results (such as <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code>), even in error cases. These functional concepts are similar across Rust, Scala, and Python, though syntax differs.</p>
